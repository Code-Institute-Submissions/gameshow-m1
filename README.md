The online gaming streaming world has exploded in the last decades. With good Wi-Fi and a charismatic approach, gamers are flocking to online streams to watch players complete their favourite games.
The development of streaming platforms such as Twitch, YouTube and Patreon has allowed gaming streamers to create a fan base like no other.

The aim of this site is to allow the streamers’ fans to follow all the great upcoming and new content of the stream channel. Users can see the games that will be played, what the streamer is currently playing, what the streamer is excited about as a professional gamer and his favourite games of all time. It allows the site users to also recommend a game for streaming either through a form or letting them know on the provided social media links.

The site is designed to be responsive and accessible across all device sizes, allowing easy navigation for fans or potential fans.

### _Who/ What/ How_
**Who is it for?** Fans of the gamers online streaming channel

**What is it for?** A hub of all the activity related to their channel along with add-ons such as recommending a game, or getting in touch

**How will it achieve this?** By presenting my upcoming streams/games/future games on a mobile-friendly responsive site for fans to peruse

### _User Stories_
There has been a massive increase in professional game streamers on Twitch & YouTube over the past few years. Whilst technology has aided this, very few streamers provide information on games they are currently playing or when their next stream will be. Twitch & YouTube do not notify fans of a channel when the next stream will be, and there is a chance I will miss it.
Hence, I want a site independent of the streaming platforms where I can easily:
1.	See what my favourite streamer is playing
2.	See when the next stream is 
3.	See what their thoughts are regarding their favourite games 
4.	Recommend a game I think the streamer would be fun playing, I want to be able to recommend this without simply commenting on YouTube
5.	Follow the site links easily

## Design Features

#### Wireframes
* Desktop wireframe - [attached](https://github.com/aryan008/gameshow-m1/blob/master/assets/rm_files/Wireframe%20-%20Desktop.pdf)
* Tablet wireframe - [attached](https://github.com/aryan008/gameshow-m1/blob/master/assets/rm_files/Wireframe%20-%20Tablet.pdf)
* Mobile wireframe - [attached](https://github.com/aryan008/gameshow-m1/blob/master/assets/rm_files/Wireframe%20-%20Mobile.pdf)

#### Typography
Poppins is used as the main font on the site, as imported through Google Fonts. Sans-serif is used as the fallback font. According to an article on [mock plus](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/google-web-fonts):

_“Poppins is a geometric sans-serif font. It is very attractive and can be widely used in business card design, news media, posters, PPT files, film, television production and content display. Poppins is featured in more than 4,000,000 websites.”_

Given the display nature of this description and the look of the font’s “gaming” feel, I decided to use this throughout the project.

#### Colour Scheme
The main colours used on the site are black and white:
* #000000 (black)
*	#fafafa (white)
*	#686767fa (grey)
* with a linear-gradient background that rotates from top to bottom (and vice versa depending on the section using a version of this white) (#686767fa, #000000)

The reason for this is to achieve a “glass” effect on the icons and text presented, making them pop more to the screen reader. 
Further, the background also blends from jet black to slightly grey in a bottom direction, allowing seamless blending to the layout of the site.

According to [designwebkit](https://designwebkit.com/design/gaming-website-templates-professional-tips-build-game-website/#:~:text=As%20you%20may%20notice%2C%20most,brown%2C%20grey%2C%20and%20khaki.):

_“Most popular gaming websites use dark colour scheme for their websites to create a mystic and engaging ambiance. The most popular colours for such websites are black, brown, grey, and khaki”._

Adaptive colour scheme is presented for the console icons and social links.

Console icons:
* [Playstation](http://www.brandgradients.com/playstation-colors/)
* [Xbox](https://www.designpieces.com/palette/xbox-one-colour-palette-hex-rgb/)
*	[Nintendo Switch](https://www.designpieces.com/palette/nintendo-switch-brand-colours-hex-and-rgb/)

Social links:
* [Instagram](http://www.brandgradients.com/instagram-colors/)
*	[Youtube](https://brandpalettes.com/youtube-color-codes/)
*	[Twitter](https://brandpalettes.com/twitter-colors/)
*	[Twitch](https://www.designpieces.com/palette/twitch-color-palette-hex-and-rgb/)

The colour schemes presented on the shadowing of the gamer card icons are purely shadowing the colour of the main icon.
The progress bars colouring is linked between the categories they respresent and the top 5 games to ensure consistency and layout design.

#### Imagery
The site uses a hero image on the landing page to convey a dark gaming ambience that is not overpowering to the site user. 
For each game noted on the site, circled “cards” are conveyed along with the text information. The contrast between these cards and the colour scheme allow the images to pop to the user with no foreground/background distraction.
Social media and console icons are presented in both the footer and the modal, again providing contrast between the icons and the background.
Horizontal bars are presented for the ratings section with a clear contrast display to the user.

#### Visual Hierarchy
According to the following article on [Visual Hierarchy](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy):

“Visual hierarchy controls the delivery of the experience. If you have a hard time figuring out where to look on a page, it’s more than likely that its layout is missing a clear visual hierarchy.”

The following characteristics per the article are manipulated (article narrative in bold, developer response in italic):
* __Size – Users notice larger elements more easily.__ _Large glass cards provide a pop effect to the user_
* __Colour – Bright colours typically attract more attention than muted ones.__ _The contrast between black background and white text attracts the user the read the text more visibly. The shadow effect around the gaming cards along with the background blending creates a solid contrast to the information presented_
* __Contrast – Dramatically contrasted colours are more eye-catching.__ _As noted above_
* __Repetition – Repeating styles can suggest content is related.__ _The style is repetitive – information for the user follow the same pattern_
*	__Proximity – Closely placed elements seem related.__ _Content is grouped based on spacing for user readability sectioning_
*	__Whitespace – More space around elements draws the eye towards them.__ _Spacing is used effectively according to the hub needs of the product goals_
*	__Texture and Style – Richer textures stand out over flat ones.__ _As noted in the typography section_

#### Features implemented

##### Responsive navigation section
* The navigation displays both the site name (when clicked brings you back to the landing page) and the other site pages that the user can browse. For mobile design, the site pages collapse into a burger icon by using Bootstrap’s JavaScript, enabling the user to toggle on mobile devices. 
* The navigation displays a “call to action” for the user to allow them to recommend a game on a multi-choice gaming platform
* A state change is implemented on the site as they navigate through it through the use of “active” sheet

##### Colours & Fonts
* Background colour is set using a “shading effect”, displaying a futuristic and blended approach from jet black to light grey
* Font colour is set in contrast to the background as white. This gives the affect of user-friendly-readability and gives the “pop” sensation of text overlapping the dark background
*	Social icons and gaming platform icons are set as per their respective icons on their websites, displaying to the user the visual norm they are used to on these sites
*	The game cards have a shading applied to give an extra emphasis on the colouring in contrast with the background
*	Poppins is used as the playful “funky” text of choice for the site, providing a rich texture of gaming-esque style of display along with professional contrast colouring

##### Landing page background image and text
*	The image in the background of the landing page is of a streaming nature, appealing to the users feelings of a professional game design. The colouring of this is shaded and blended into the non-image section of the site
*	The text overlaying the background conveys to the user what the site is designed for
*	The three action cards overlaying the background highlight the sites function in minimal words. This is common in gaming sites as taglines need to be short and memorable

##### Footer
*	The “Let Me Know” section generates a “call to action” once again to the user to get in touch, invoking a personable touch rather than a streaming comments section. The form is intentionally kept simple and allows the user to recommend a game/platform in the smallest number of clicks. Once submitted, colour submit button changes on successful submission.
*	The “Add My Gamer Handle” allows the user to easily add the streamer as a friend online in the gaming world
*	The “Social Links” allows the user to follow the streamer on multiple social platforms

##### Game icons
*	The game icons throughout the site and their respective shading provide the “pop” effect that stand out massively to the user. The display/shading/colouring/clarity of these icons are bigger in size and allow the user to notice them easily

##### Layout
*	All the site’s pages are structured visually (font/colouring/areas) consistently throughout, creating a common theme for the users of the site. The hierarchy presented tells the user extremely quickly where to look on a page and how to navigate the site.
*	“Pop” effect colouring is used on both game icons and review content areas to stand out to the user in a visually appealing sense

#### Features left to implement
*	Automatically updated streaming information
*	Member login and chat rooms between user and streamer
*	Live streaming from the website

## Technology and Languages used

### Languages

*	[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
*	[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programmes

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
Used as part of responsive navigation design for mobile devices

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
Used to create the streaming platform icons, the social site icons and the console icons

[GitHub](https://github.com/)
Used to store projects code upon Git push

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
Used for version control through the Gitpod terminal and the Git add/commit/push action sequence

[Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/microsoft-365/word)
Used for designing of the wireframes as I am completing this project on my work laptop with no access to Balsamiq

[Bootstrap 4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
Bootstrap was used to aid in the responsive of the design of the site across device sizes. It also brought the need down for CSS styling, although custom styling was appropriately included when the outcome of that design was better than the default Bootstrap design

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Used to add Poppins and related font weights to the css style file using the @import url function. To improve site load times, this file is loaded into the head element of the HTML pages and backed up by using sans-serif in CSS.

## Testing

### Code validation
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - Results

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - Results

### Accessibility Testing

[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) were used to test the site's accessibility.

Issues arose during testing-->
Shown issues were updated for with the following scores.

### Responsive Testing
[Chrome devtools device mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode) was used to test the site’s responsiveness. Manual testing was also performed via resizing the browser to review for issues at varying browser screen sizes.

No known issues were found.

### Manual testing
1. *Navigation of the site using the navigation links in the header*
  * Expected: User can move seamlessly through the site without using the back button on their browser
  * Testing: Tested by only using the provided navigation links
  * Result: User can move throughout the site using the navigation links provided
  * Fix: As above, no fix needed
2. *The modal form requires a game name to be submitted*
  * Expected: When recommending a game, the user inputs the name of the game before hitting submit
  * Testing: Tested by leaving the field blank
  * Result: The form submitted regardless of an empty field due to "required" missing from the form label in the html file
  * Fix: Added "required" to the html form label and re-tested. No further issues.
3. *The burger icon appears as the navigation hub on mobile devices and is pinned to the top of the site*
  * Expected: On mobile view, all of the pages the user can cycle through are collapsed into a burger icon that is consistently at the top of the page
  * Testing: Resized the browsers on Chrome developer tools to mobile-only and scrolled down each page
  * Result: Burger icon is visible on mobile-only devices and is pinned to the top on scrolling
  * Fix: As above, no fix needed
4. *Responsive design is present on non-large devices*
  * Expected: On tablet/mobile viewing, certain text content on the site is removed/formatted appropriately
  * Testing: Tested by resizing each page to tablet/mobile and viewing the resulting site content on these browser widths
  * Result: Certain tables content were not mobile-friendly for the user to view, essentially too much content was present for the viewport width space available
  * Fix: Using bootstrap grid system, non-fundamental columns (as defined by user goals) were hidden on mobile design. Further, media-width was utilised for font-sizes for mobile appropriateness. No further issues noted after these fixes were applied on responsive design.
5. *Images/text presented on the site do not stretch on different viewports and "pop" to the user*
  * Expected: Across all pages and viewport sizes, images look crisp to the user and the text alongside them is easily readable
  * Testing: Reviewed all icons/text across all viewport sizes
  * Result: Images stay clean and sharp, whilst text displays easily to the reader
  * Fix: As above, no fix needed


### Further testing
* Social links in the footer were tested to ensure that they opened up in a seperate browser when clicked
* The navigation items throughout the site were tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I cannot get access to any further testing hubs due to restrictions on my laptop
