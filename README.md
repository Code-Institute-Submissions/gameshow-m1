The online gaming streaming world has exploded in the last decades. With good Wi-Fi and a charismatic approach, gamers are flocking to online streams to watch players complete their favourite games.
The development of streaming platforms such as Twitch, YouTube and Patreon has allowed gaming streamers to create a fan base like no other.

The aim of this site is to allow the streamers’ fans to follow all the great upcoming and new content of the stream channel. Users can see the games that will be played, what the streamer is currently playing, what the streamer is excited about as a professional gamer and his favourite games of all time. It allows the site users to also recommend a game for streaming either through a form or letting them know on the provided social media links.

The site is designed to be responsive and accessible across all device sizes, allowing easy navigation for fans or potential fans.
